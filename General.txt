To check SQL performance, you can use various methods and tools. Here are some common ones:

*Methods:*

1. *EXPLAIN*: Analyze query execution plans using EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
2. *Query Profiler*: Use built-in profilers like SQL Server Profiler or Oracle's SQL Trace.
3. *Database Logs*: Check database logs for errors, slowdowns, or performance metrics.
4. *System Monitoring*: Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic.

*Tools:*

1. *SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)*: Use the Performance Dashboard and Query Store.
2. *Oracle Enterprise Manager*: Monitor performance metrics and SQL execution plans.
3. *MySQL Workbench*: Use the Query Profiler and Performance Schema.
4. *PostgreSQL*: Use pg_stat_statements and pg_badger.
5. *Third-party tools*: New Relic, SolarWinds, Quest Foglight, and AppDynamics.

*Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):*

1. *Query execution time*
2. *CPU usage*
3. *Disk I/O*
4. *Memory usage*
5. *Lock contention*
6. *Index usage*
7. *Cache hit ratio*

*Common Performance Issues:*

1. *Poor indexing*
2. *Inefficient queries*
3. *Lock contention*
4. *Insufficient resources*
5. *Database fragmentation*

*Best Practices:*

1. *Optimize queries*
2. *Regularly maintain indexes*
3. *Monitor performance*
4. *Test and optimize database configuration*
5. *Upgrade hardware as needed*
